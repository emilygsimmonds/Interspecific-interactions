# Interspecific-interactions

## Introduction to the project

This repository holds all of the code for a simulation study into the 
quantification of interspecific interactions from time series data.

In this project I will look at three types of interaction:

- Predator/prey (-/+)
- Competitive (-/-)
- Mutualist (+/+)

## Details of the study

The simulation study has four steps:

1) Generate simulations of species time series data
2) Run a Nimble model for the simulated data
3) Run an INLA model for the simulated data
4) Evaluate the model performances

More detail on each step (including the scripts required to run it) are given 
below.

### Generate simulations of time series data

This is done in the [Simulation_creation.R](https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/Interspecific-interactions/blob/main/Simulation_creation.R) script, which uses the [Gompertz_function.R](https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/Interspecific-interactions/blob/main/Gompertz_function.R) function and the [Simulation_function.R](https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/Interspecific-interactions/blob/main/Simulation_function.R). 

I simultaneously simulate two time series of observed population size ($Y$) 
for species $i$ and species $j$ and the log population size. 

To do this, I use the following equations (Gompertz equations on the log-linear 
scale):

$$
Y_i \~ Pois(exp(N_i))
$$
$$
N_i = r_i + c_i N_i + \alpha_{ij} N_j + e_i
$$

$$
Y_j \~ Pois(exp(N_j))
$$
$$
N_j = r_j + c_j N_j + \alpha_{ji} N_i + e_j
$$

where, $N$ = log actual population size, $r$ = intrinsic growth rate, 
$c$ = intraspecific competition (density dependence), 
$/alpha$ = interspecific effect, 
$e$ = random error. 

Both the true population size and the observed population size including 
Poisson error are output. 

I simulate populations using the following baseline parameter values:

- starting population size = 100
- $r_i$ = $r_j$ = 1.25
- $c_i$ = $c_j$ = 0.74

The values of alpha depend on the type of interaction:

- Predator/prey: $\alpha_{ij}$ = -0.16, $\alpha_{ji}$ = 0.16
- Competitive: $\alpha_{ij}$ = $\alpha_{ji}$ = 0.13
- Mutulaist: $\alpha_{ij}$ = $\alpha_{ji}$ = -0.18

### Run a Nimble model for the simulated data

The Nimble model is run using the script [NimbleModel.R](https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/Interspecific-interactions/blob/main/NimbleModel.R) using the output
from [Simulation_creation.R](https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/Interspecific-interactions/blob/main/Simulation_creation.R). 

This uses a gridded approach to estimating the $\alpha$ values (inter-specific
interactions). These parameters proved hard to estimate using MCMC. 

For anyone that does not know Nimble, there is a cheatsheet [here:](https://r-nimble.org/cheatsheets/NimbleCheatSheet.pdf). Nimble runs in 
C++ and requires a C++ compiler to be installed. Instructions to install can be 
found [here:](https://r-nimble.org/html_manual/cha-installing-nimble.html).

### Run an INLA model for the simulated data

The INLA model is run using the script [INLAModel.R](https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/Interspecific-interactions/blob/main/INLAModel.R) using the output
from [Simulation_creation.R](https://github.com/emilygsimmonds/Interspecific-interactions/blob/main/Simulation_creation.R).
